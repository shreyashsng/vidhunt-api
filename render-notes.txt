# Alternative deployment method if Playwright fails

# Step 1: Use render.yaml for better control
build:
  - pip install -r requirements.txt
  - playwright install-deps
  - playwright install chromium

# Step 2: Environment variables needed:
PYTHON_VERSION=3.11.9
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/opt/render/project/.cache/ms-playwright

# Step 3: If Playwright still fails, you can:
# 1. Use render-build.sh instead of build.sh
# 2. Try the Docker deployment option
# 3. Contact Render support for Playwright-specific help
